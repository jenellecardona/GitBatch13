********Review***********
1. what is git?
it is a version control tool.
2. What is a local repostiory?
a storage that is on our computer
3. what is a remote repository?
github
4. Architecture of git :
3-stage architecture--->wokring directory ,staging area, repo
working directory:
gitporject1 -->pom, src, target, .idea
5. where should u create your local git repository?
ideally you should create you repo inside your working directory i.e in
this case gitProject1
Note:
One repo for one single project
No subRepos are advised
----------------------------------Tracking your first project using git---
-------------------
1. Decide the location where to create the repository and navigate my MR
terminal to that particular directory
2. intitalize an empty repository  git init---> to initalize an empty
repository
to delete a repo, simply delete the .git folder
3. git status--> shows u untacked files in red color
--> shows u the tracked files ingreen color
4. git add . --> moves all the files to the staging area ..
5. git commit -m "commit message" --> sends all the files from the
staging area to the local repo
6. git status after the commit shows working tree clean  becuase  we have
all the threee stages i.e working directory , staging area and local
repo synchronised
---------------------------------Some Advance git commands-------------
1. to view the files in your staging area --> git ls-files
2. to remove any file from the staging area --> git rm --cached filename
3. to restore files from staging area to your wokring directory use -->
git restore .
4. in order to see the difference of the files in the staging area and
wokring directory we
can use the command -->git diff
git diff  is going to show us ethe difference in each file that has
been modified
- usually means that the line was deleted and +means it was replaced
by this line
but that is not something that will alwyas be true
u need to focus on line number also mentioned on the top like
@@ -4,6 +4,6 @@  : shows the line number in hwich the changes were
made
5. shows difference in files in staging area and the  repository----->git
diff --staged
------------------------The gitignore file--------------------------------
--
to ignore the file from being tracked by git we use gitignore
1. create a .gitignore file
a. touch .gitignore--> creates a .gitignore file
2. enter the name of the files that you want git to ignore from tracking
and save the file
--> that file will be ignored
in order to ignore a complete folder write down the name of the folder
in gitignore
e.g if u want to ignore target folder in .gitignore type    target/
-------------------------Sending our local repo to github-----------
1. create a new remote repository
2. Establish a connection --> git remote add origin URL
3. check the connection  --> git remote -v
4. to delete the connection --> git remote remove origin
5. git branch -M main  -->naming the branch
6. first time push "git push -u origin main"  for the rest of time just
git push will work too.
-----------------------Git Cloning----------------
git clone helps us get the code from the remote repositories on our
computer
